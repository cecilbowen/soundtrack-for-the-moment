# soundtrack-for-the-moment
Provides a soundtrack for your epic speeches.

This is a silly project I made for my friends and I.  We send a lot of voice clips to each other in varying group chats (like Discord, for example).  And sometimes, to add dramatic effect, we would search up some music to play as we sent them to add immersion to the message we were sending.  This makes that search easier with some pre-made song choices for the "mood" of the voice clip.
